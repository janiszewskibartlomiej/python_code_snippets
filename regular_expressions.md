### Regex Metacharacters 
I have created a table that will define every metacharacter that you can use to define your own
regex. 
* . Matches any single character except newline 
* ^ Matches the beginning of the string 
* $ Match at the end of a string
* \* Match zero or more repetitions
* \+ Match one or more repetitions
* [] Defines a character class 
* | Behaves like “or” logic
* ()Creates a group 
* \ Introduces a special character like “\s” for “space” 
* {m} Matches m repetitions 
* {m,n} Matches m to n, inclusive repetitions
